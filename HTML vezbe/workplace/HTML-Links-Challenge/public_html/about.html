            <h3 id="one">Building a Successful Company</h3>
            <p>
                It all starts with the right people, and our team is the best you’ll
                find. Our vertical integration strategy combined with years
                of experience in the IT industry, allowed us to excel into one of
                the best IT centers in Sothern Europe, in a relatively short time.
            </p>
            <h3 id="two">Our Story</h3>

            <p>
                Our story began in 2007, when our company was established under 
                the name Web Solutions, offering ground-breaking web solutions 
                and online marketing services to big and mid-sized companies. 
                Fast forward four years and Web Solutions joins forces with a 
                company called Media Services to form a corporate company called Cubes.
                Today, Cubes is an industry leader offering full IT support.
                From web to mobile development to education and outsourcing, 
                Cubes is truly a one of a kind company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cubes started out with a goal of combining all IT services in
                one place. We wanted to offer our clients quality products at a
                reasonable price. To accomplish our goal, we adapted the vertical
                integration strategy that allows us to control each aspect of our
                business process. The big advantage we have over other IT companies
                is that we educate our own employees. Cubes formed a school that has,
                so far, successfully produced 5 generations of web and mobile
                developers. In fact, most of our employees today are Cubes School
                graduates. “Cubes School” is a project we are very passionate about,
                and extremely proud of. It allows us to not only contribute
                to Serbia’s economy, but also have an endless supply of extremely
                intelligent and hardworking developers, which is what
                differentiates us from other companies.
            </p>

            <h3 id="three">Our model</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, Cubes School is what really gives us an edge
                over our competitors and is also the core of our business model. 
                We educate over 200 new programmers each year, and we keep the best
                100 on retainer to work on our projects. Some of them are outsourced
                to other companies, while others work on in-house projects.
                While many IT companies deal with a shortage of quality programmers,
                we always have more than enough available talent to work on our projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cubes offers a wide variety of services. We offer everything from
                “off-the shelve” generic solutions, to custom tailored solutions,
