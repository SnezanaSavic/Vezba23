            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Our story began in <i>2007</i>, when our company was established
                under the name
                <b>Web Solutions</b>, offering ground-breaking web solutions and online
                marketing
                services to big and mid-sized companies. Fast forward four
                years and Web Solutions
                joins forces with a company called <i>Media Services </i>to form
                a corporate 
                company called <strong>Cubes</strong>. Today, <strong>Cubes</strong> is an
                industry leader 
                offering full <b>IT</b>
                support. From web to mobile development to education
                and outsourcing, 
                <strong>Cubes</strong> is truly a one of a kind company.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Cubes</strong> started out with a goal of combining all <b>IT </b>
                services
                in one place.
                We wanted to offer our clients quality products at a reasonable 
                price. 
                To accomplish our goal, we adapted the vertical integration
                strategy that
                allows us to control each aspect of our business process. 
                The big advantage
                we have over other IT companies is that we educate our own 
                employees. 
                <i>Cubes</i> formed a school that has, so far, successfully
                produced 5 generations
                of web and mobile developers. In fact, most of our employees
                today are 
                <strong>Cubes School</strong>graduates. <strong>“Cubes School”</strong>is a project
                we are very
                passionate
                about, and extremely proud of. It allows us to not only 
                contribute to Serbia’s
                economy, but also have an endless supply of extremely intelligent
                and hardworking
                developers, which is what differentiates us from other companies
            </p> </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Our Model</h2>

            <p> As mentioned before, <strong>Cubes School</strong> is what really gives us an
                edge
                over our
                competitors and is also the core of our business model. We educate
                over 200
                new programmers each year, and we keep the best 100 on retainer to
                work on
                our projects. Some of them are outsourced to other companies, while
                others
                work on in-house projects. While many IT companies deal with a
                shortage of
                quality programmers, we always have more than enough available
                talent
                to work
                on our projects.
            </p>
