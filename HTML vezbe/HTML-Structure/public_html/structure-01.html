                        <p>
                            It all starts with the right people, and our team is the best you’ll find.
                            Our vertical integration strategy combined with years of experience in the
                            IT industry, allowed us to excel into one of the best IT centers in Southern
                            Europe, in a relatively short time.

                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our story began in 2007, when our company was established under the name
                            Web Solutions, offering ground-breaking web solutions and online marketing
                            services to big and mid-sized companies. Fast forward four years and Web Solutions
                            joins forces with a company called Media Services to form a corporate 
                            company called Cubes. Today, Cubes is an industry leader offering full IT
                            support. From web to mobile development to education and outsourcing, 
                            Cubes is truly a one of a kind company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cubes started out with a goal of combining all IT services in one place.
                            We wanted to offer our clients quality products at a reasonable price. 
                            To accomplish our goal, we adapted the vertical integration strategy that
                            allows us to control each aspect of our business process. The big advantage
                            we have over other IT companies is that we educate our own employees. 
                            Cubes formed a school that has, so far, successfully produced 5 generations
                            of web and mobile developers. In fact, most of our employees today are 
                            Cubes School graduates. “Cubes School” is a project we are very passionate
                            about, and extremely proud of. It allows us to not only contribute to Serbia’s
                            economy, but also have an endless supply of extremely intelligent and hardworking
                            developers, which is what differentiates us from other companies

                        <h3>Our Model</h3>

                        <p>
                            As mentioned before, Cubes School is what really gives us an edge over our
                            competitors and is also the core of our business model. We educate over 200
                            new programmers each year, and we keep the best 100 on retainer to work on
                            our projects. Some of them are outsourced to other companies, while others
                            work on in-house projects. While many IT companies deal with a shortage of
                            quality programmers, we always have more than enough available talent to work
                            on our projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            generic solutions, to custom tailored solutions, as well as educational services,

                            products we have developed an Online Shop, a News Platform and an ERP for

                            business. We will take care of everything from web and mobile applications
